## Introduction
Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) is a new recommendation framework based on graph neural network, explicitly encoding the collaborative signal in the form of high-order connectivities in user-item bipartite graph by performing embedding propagation.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* tensorflow == 1.8.0
* numpy == 1.14.3
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.19.1
